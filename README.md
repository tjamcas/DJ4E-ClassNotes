# DJ4E-ClassNotes
Class notes (in Markdown) that I wrote for the "Django for Everybody (DJ4E)" specialization class series from the University of Michigan.    

- *These files are my student notes from the "Django for Everybody (DJ4E)" MOOC series created by Dr. Charles Severance, University of Michigan. The materials in the DJ4E courses are available under a Creative Commons License to allow for teachers to make use of these materials in their own courses.*  
- *My student notes contain images based on the DJ4E presentation slides, also created by Dr. Severance as course resources. The notes and images in this document were assembled by me as my personal learning aid to reinforce the course content and as a reference for completing the course assignments and quizzes.*    

I highly recommend Dr. Chuck's "Django for Everybody" MOOC series. Throughout the course series, links and references are made to supplemental documentation for Python and Django libraries. In my opinion, in order to master the subject matter, the student should consider these references as required - and not simply recommended - reading. It can be very easy for a student to slip into "watching" mode when taking the course and letting the information "wash over" the viewer. In order to absorb the material, it is very important for the student to examine the code that is presented and consult the recommended reference documentation with an inquiring mind.    

If you are planning to start or continue the DJ4E class series, I wish you "Good luck!"
